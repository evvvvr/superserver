# superserver
Simple superserver program inspired by inetd and xinetd.
Listens to new connections on TCP port then starts appropriate service program reading from connection socket to service's stdin
and writes to socket from service's stdout.

##Command-line Options
```
-f string
        Config file path (default is superserver.toml)
-t duration
        Child services termination timeout (default 3s)
```

##Config File Syntax
```
[[service]]
name = "very-test" # unique name to help identify service
port = 3030 # service port
program = "/home/me/service" # program to be executed for service
program-args = ["service", "foo"] # arguments to be passed to service program, optional

[[service]]
...
```

##__SIGINT__, __SIGTERM__
Makes superserver stop accepting new connections, close children stdin and if they
didn't exit â€” send them ```SIGTERM``` and wait termination timeout for services to complete before
killing them and exiting superserver.

##Details
Writing to child service's stderr sends data to superserver's stderr.

Child services has empty environment.

Killing child services doesn't kills processes started by them: superserver only kills its children, but not grandchildren.

##TODO
* Better logging.
* More inetd/xinetd-like config and command-line options.
* Check (and maybe allow to configure) read buffer size for network connections and child services.
